# Hyprland

Hyprland is a Dynamic Tiling Wayland Compositor taking on some innovative and *groovin'* ideas. It's written fully in C++.
For Hyprland without the land part, see [Hypr](https://github.com/vaxerski/Hypr), the Xorg window manager.


VERY early dev. And I mean VERY. It's yet to be really usable, but I am developing it!
